```groovy
def foo(Closure c) {
  c.delegate = this //this should be the expected object 
  c() 
}

class MyClass{
  String name = "Example"
  def foo(Closure c){
    c.delegate = this
    c()
  }
}

def main(){
  def myInstance = new MyClass()
  myInstance.foo { println name }
  foo { println it.toString() } // this will throw exception
}
```
The problem arises from a misunderstanding of the `this` keyword within the context of the method. To correctly set the delegate, either pass the intended object explicitly or ensure the closure has access to the necessary properties through a different mechanism (e.g., binding). The corrected code clarifies the delegate object.
